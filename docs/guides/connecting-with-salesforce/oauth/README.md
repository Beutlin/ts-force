# oAuth

Common oAuth flows are supported via two "utility" functions:

* `getAuthorizationUrl`
* `requestAccessToken`

See sub sections for examples of each supported flow.

[Reference Salesforce's official documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_oauth_flows.htm&type=5) to see full list of parameters for each oAuth flow.
