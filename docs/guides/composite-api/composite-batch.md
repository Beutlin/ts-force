# Composite Batch

Executes up to 25 subrequests in a single request. The response bodies and HTTP statuses of the subrequests in the batch are returned in a single response body. Each subrequest counts against rate limits.  Unlike the "Composite" API, you cannot use the output in subsequent requests.
